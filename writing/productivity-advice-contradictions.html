            <p>Some productivity advice contradictions I've noticed:</p>
            <ul class="writing-bullets">
               <li>"if it takes less than 5 minutes, do the task now" vs. "focus on the big things, the mail can wait"</li>
               <li>"challenging yourself is the best way to learn" vs. "focus on having really solid basics"</li>
               <li>"use coffee or adderall" vs. "focus on getting in touch with your natural motivation"</li>
               <li>"get up early" vs. "make sure you're well rested"</li>
               <li>"get started on your projects long before they're due" vs. "work expands to fill the time available"</li>
               <li>"when inspiration or excitement strikes, ride it out as long as you can" vs. "take breaks" / "use the Pomodoro Technique"</li>
               <li>"keep your grand plans private until you've accomplished them" vs. "talk through your plans with others"</li>
               <li>"be disciplined" vs. "choose the work that isn't work for you"</li>
               <li>"do the most difficult thing first before you're tired out by other tasks" vs. "do the easiest thing first to get on a roll / get a success spiral going"</li>
               <li>"a foundation of eating well, exercising, and meditating will help you achieve your goals" vs. "the only way to get good at X is to do X, don't rationalize distractions"</li>
               <li>"eat that frog (focus on completing your most important task)" vs. "use procrastination on task A to help you do task B (the thesis of the book The Art of Procrastination)"</li>
            </ul>
