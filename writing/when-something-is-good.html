            <h2>ELOISE LIKES WRITING: <span class="writing-post-title">WHEN SOMETHING IS GOOD</span></h2>
            <hr class="bottom-hr">
            <p>When something is good, a question I'm left with is "ok, why not do this even more then?" Sometimes there's no good reason, and more would be better. But it's satisfying when I try out doing more and find that the limit was there for a reason and humanity isn't just leaving goodness on the table.</p>
            <p>Two examples:</p>
            <ol class="writing-post-ol">
               <li>I, like most people, enjoy buttery mashed potatoes. When I put a stick of butter in my potatoes, it's good, and I ask, why not even more? Recently I tried out a recipe with a 1:2 ratio of butter to potatoes—a truly thrilling amount of butter—and discovered that the reason we don't usually do that is because it's gross. (Recipe <a href="https://chatelaine.com/recipes/joel-robuchon-mashed-potato-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> for the curious.)</li>
               <li>I have a friend who is very warm. She naturally likes people, and emphasizes her like of them, and reaches out to her friends, so that her friends feel loved. It's good! I have an acquaintance who seems to like people even more than that, and emphasizes her like of them even more, and reaches out with even more enthusiasm, and it's weird and off-putting.</li>
            </ol>
