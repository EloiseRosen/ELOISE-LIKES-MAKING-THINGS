        <p>I didn't visit my parents for Thanksgiving this year, but I did make a Thanksgiving feast for the guinea pigs.<br>The menu: Cornlet “corn on the cob”, diced green bean and sweet potato casserole, salad with tomatoes, and pumpkin "pie" with cranberry slices</p>
        <p>Special accommodations were made for Vesper to attend the meal from within her hiding container because she wasn't feeling up to leaving.</p>
        <p>I expected that the guinea pigs may have poor table manners and had prepared for this possibility by glueing down the plates and the table cloth. However, I was not prepared for Aurora climbing on the table, stepping in the pumpkin pie, and stealing salad off of someone else's plate. No one fought about politics though, so I think it was still a win.</p>
