            <hr class="bottom-hr">
            <p>A lot of mental disorders seem like they involve systematic error in updating on new evidence:</p>
            <br>
            <p>UPDATING TOO LITTLE ON OPTIMISTIC EVIDENCE</p>
            <ul class="writing-bullets">
               <li>imposter syndrome (e.g. you get hired in an impressive position but explain it away instead of updating that maybe you're more competent than you thought)</li>
               <li>depression</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>UPDATING TOO LITTLE ON PESSIMISTIC EVIDENCE</p>
            <ul class="writing-bullets">
               <li>delusions of grandeur, like in mania (e.g. feeling sure that your novel is genius, and the fact that your roommate read it and seemed confused/concerned rather than blown away doesn't dampen your belief at all)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>UPDATING TOO MUCH ON NEW EVIDENCE</p>
            <ul class="writing-bullets">
               <li>borderline personality disorder (e.g. mood swings, splitting, frequently switching planned careers)</li>
               <li>schizophrenia (Most people have a close to unshakeable prior that the news anchor isn't sending them secret messages through the TV, which barely budges if the news anchor says something eerily relevant. People with schizophrenia aren't like this.)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>UPDATING TOO LITTLE ON NEW EVIDENCE</p>
            <ul class="writing-bullets">
               <li>??? The closest thing I can think of is "being too set in your ways", which is unfortunate but not a mental disorder.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Is there a mental disorder that involves systematically updating too little?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Edit: Enoch Ko suggests PTSD, which I think is a very good answer.</p>
