            <p>When I was first learning to write my name as a small child, I wrote the E like this green "E", or variations thereof. It seems like I conceptualized E as a vertical line with some horizontal lines coming off to the right, the exact number of which was a creative decision to be made by the artist at the time of execution.</p>
            <p>And I just realized that I do the same with asterisks as an adult! Upon inspection, my asterisks have anywhere between 3 and 5 crossed lines in them. I looked it up and there is actually some disagreement in the asterisk community about exactly how many points the star should have (although the 10 points of my 5-line asterisk is well outside the Overton window).</p>
