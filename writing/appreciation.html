         <p>When walking outside I sometimes get a sense of appreciation for how paradise-like my surroundings are.</p>
         <p>I walk to the park near my home. A park! How absurdly utopian it is that we’ve fenced off an area that’s sole purpose is just to be nice. In the park there are pigeons waddling around fat on French fries, because food is so abundant that people are sometimes careless with it. (And French fries exist! Transcendent deliciousness beyond a cave man’s wildest dreams.)</p>
         <p>In the park there’s an area where dogs can be off-leash. Happy golden retrievers run around. There is a small child who owns their own personal glittery princess backpack. The child is safe. There is a chihuahua in a sweater. My species has reached such ridiculous heights of decadence that we can spend time on chihuahuas in sweaters, instead of murdering each other for scraps or whatever. The sun is bright.</p>
