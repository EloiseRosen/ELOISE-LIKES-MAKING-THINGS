            <hr class="bottom-hr">
            <p>Some thoughts on food and cooking:</p>

            <ol class="writing-post-ol">
               <li>I would have never guessed that cream would turn into whipped cream and then butter just from mixing it a lot. It makes me wonder if there are other things that would turn into something good that we just haven't tried mixing yet.</li>
               <li>I've long been suspicious that recipes tend to have extra steps that aren't really necessary (that is, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference in a blind taste test). I think when you're writing a recipe you're not really in an efficient and critical mindset, you're in a mindset of doing fun fancy things in the kitchen. The recipes I make a lot tend to get streamlined over time as I try shortcuts and find some parts that don't seem to matter.</li>
               <li>Between the fridge and freezer, I want a third compartment that's a little warmer than the freezer, so that ice cream isn't rock hard when you take it out.</li>
               <li>I haven't been able to find a frozen pizza brand that is half cheese half pepperoni (or more generally half vegetarian half meat), which surprises me. I would have thought there would be a market for that for couples or friends where one is vegetarian and the other isn't, and it would be cute.</li>
               <li>Appetizers do the opposite of "stimulating one's appetite". The real appetizer course is watching a cooking show while some garlic saut√©s fragrantly in the distance.</li>
            </ol>
