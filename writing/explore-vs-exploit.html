            <hr class="bottom-hr">
            <p>An implication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">explore vs. exploit tradeoffs</a> that I hadn't appreciated before: life should get better over time (in some waysâ€”unfortunately we still age).</p>
            <p>Earlier in life is a time of exploration and therefore lower payoffs (as you try things that don't work out well), and later in life is a time of exploitation of the highest payoff things you found earlier. So at the start you're figuring out what you like and what you're good at, and this often involves bad relationships, false career starts, and social roles that don't quite fit. As you get older, you more and more understand what you personally should seek out in partners and jobs, spend your free time on hobbies that bring you joy, and get established in your favorite location.</p>
